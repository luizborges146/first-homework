# Optimize website,
Optimize website, consolidate and organize semantic structure



## Description

On this assignment, Optimize the website to be more accessible was the goal. Modifying the CSS, to eliminate what was not being used, and also consolidate part of the code to optimize the website, eliminating redundancy.

Also corrected some of the errors on the HTML file where the Search Engine Optimization, did not lead the user to the correct part of the page, the issue consisted on the tag set as a class instead of id. Not only that, I also alternate text for the images to follow the accessibility standards.

###### Note* I have removed the <span class="seo">seo</span> for the fact I could not see the difference in color, I use my both monitors as eye saver mode, and because the brightness is lower, was not difference for me. I increased the brightness on my screen and to see the difference, but I still decided to remove. I left the code as  a comment in case it needs to be added back. I understand that the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is part of the logo, but for the fact the colors are too close I removed it, leaving the same color for the whole logo.
