# Optimize website,
Optimize website, consolidate and organize semantic structure



## Description

On this assignment, optimizing the website to be more accessible was the goal and also modifying the CSS to eliminate redundant code.

Also corrected some of the errors on the HTML file where the Search Engine Optimization did not lead the user to the correct part of the page, the issue consisted on the tag set as a class instead of id. Not only that, I also alternate text for the images to follow the accessibility standards, and improved the semantic elements.

###### Note* I have removed the <span class="seo">seo</span> for the fact I could not see the difference in color, I use my both monitors as eye saver mode, and because the brightness is lower, was not difference. As part of my test, I increased the brightness on my screen to confirm if there was any difference, and I still could not find much difference, so that I removed the code as did not impact as much. I left the code as  a comment in case it needs to be added back. I understand that the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is part of the logo, but for the fact the colors are too close, I decided to remove it, leaving the same color for the whole logo.
